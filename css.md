### What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and lay out web pages, bringing structure to life with colors, fonts, layouts, animations, and responsiveness. It works alongside HTML to define the visual presentation of web content.

CSS enables developers to control how a website looks on various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and engaging user experience.

### Why Use CSS?
CSS is essential for modern web development because:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps style separate from content (HTML), making code easier to maintain and scale.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts layouts and styles for various screen sizes using techniques like media queries and flexbox.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across all major browsers with proper practices.
- **Styling Power:** Enables advanced visual effects with gradients, animations, and transformations.

### When Not to Use CSS?
CSS is almost always used for styling, but there are a few considerations:
- **Design Systems or Frameworks:** For large-scale projects, pre-built design systems (e.g., Material UI) or CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) might replace writing raw CSS.
- **Server-side Styling:** CSS doesnâ€™t handle server-side logic or dynamic rendering of styles without tools like SCSS or CSS-in-JS.
