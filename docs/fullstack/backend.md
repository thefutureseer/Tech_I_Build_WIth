# Backend Expertise

## 1. Server-Side Programming
- Proficient in Node.js with Express.js for building REST APIs.
- Skilled in TypeScript for type-safe backend logic.

## 2. Databases
- Designed and optimized schemas for PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- Proficient in ORM tools like Prisma and Sequelize.

## 3. APIs
- Built REST APIs for CRUD operations and complex workflows.
- Designed GraphQL schemas with optimized resolvers.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization Expertise
### Sessions
- Designed session-based authentication systems using secure, server-stored session data.
- Used session cookies for maintaining user state across requests.
- Managed session expiration, invalidation, and storage using:
  - **SQL Caching**: Optimized session-related database queries for faster lookups.
  - **Database-backed sessions**: Stored session data in **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** for persistence and scalability.

### JSON Web Token (JWT)
- Implemented JWTs for stateless, token-based authentication in REST APIs.
- Compared and selected JWTs for lightweight systems versus session-based systems for security-critical apps.

### OAuth
- Integrated **OAuth 2.0** for third-party authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub).

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Developed RBAC systems to restrict resources based on user roles.
- Example: Admins accessing management features while standard users access customer-facing features.

### Security Best Practices
- Used secure cookie flags like **HttpOnly** and **SameSite** for session cookies to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.
- Implemented rate limiting and IP-based session validation to reduce the risk of brute-force and DoS attacks.
- Protected applications from **SQL injection** by using parameterized queries and ORM tools like **Prisma** to prevent direct query manipulation.
- Prevented **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks by validating and sanitizing user input, ensuring only safe content is rendered in the application.
- Utilized **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** to control which domains can interact with the API, preventing unauthorized access.

## 5. Scalability
- Implemented **SQL caching** to optimize database query performance and reduce load by caching frequently requested data at the database level.
- Utilized **Apollo caching** to optimize GraphQL query responses, reducing network calls and enhancing the client-side performance.
- Applied **Next.js caching** techniques, including static generation (SSG) and server-side caching (ISR), to improve page load speeds and scalability of the application.
- Helped with a scalable microservices architecture using **Docker**, enabling horizontal scaling and efficient resource management.
